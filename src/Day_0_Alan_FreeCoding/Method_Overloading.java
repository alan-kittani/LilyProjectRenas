     * if you are creating an object from scratch, you have to use the "new" keyword

     * Static methods only execute one time, it is a mutual point, the variable is mutual for all objects for static.
     *
     * Static variables are CLASS MEMBERS
     *
     * you do not need and object instance to call static, whereas non-static you require instance with objects.
     *
     * example: you use Classname.staticvariablename for static calling
     * whereas for objects you use ObjectName.method/variable for non-static calling
     *
     * Name -num  class level
     * Name2- num2 object level
     *
     *
     * EXTRA NOTE:
     *
     * THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER U WORK IN THE SAME CLASS OR DIFFERENT CLASS,
     * YOU WILL JUST NEED TO IMPORT THE OTHER CLASS IF YOU USE DIFFERENT CLASSES
     *
     *
     * INSTANCE VARIABLES : METHOD WITH NO STATIC
     * CLASS VARIABLES : METHODS WITH STATIC
